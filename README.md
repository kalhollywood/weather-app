This project is a work in progress and the latest version is deployed with Netlify - [click here to see it](https://kals-weather-app.netlify.app/).
This project uses OpenWeather, Geo DB Cities and Google Maps APIs.

# Key learnings

- Learned how to obtain the users location on load-up and use the coordinates to place a marker on Google Maps and to obtain their current weather and 7 day forecast.
- Used Geo DB Cities API and passed the information from the search results to the Google Maps component and current/forecast weather components.
- Used React accessible accordion for the first time for the 7 day forecast to give further detailed information and React select async paginate on the city search options.
